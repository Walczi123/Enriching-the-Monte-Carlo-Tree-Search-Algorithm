# Enriching-the-Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search-Algorithm
This repository contains the code used during the creation of my master thesis and all the necessary files. Three types of games, a basic version of the MCTS algorithm, and many extensions of it are here included. Also, all files needed to run the tests along with their results.
