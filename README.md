# Enriching-the-Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search-Algorithm

This repository contains the code used during the creation of my master thesis and all the necessary files. Three types of games, a basic version of the MCTS algorithm, and many extensions of it are included here. Repository is also extended with all the files needed to run the tests along with their results.

# The article "Monte Carlo Tree Search with Metaheuristics"

The article based on the thesis, co-authored by the thesis supervisor Professor J. Ma≈Ñdziuk, won the Best Paper Award at the 22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing ICAISC 2023.

The poster prepared for the conference can be found [here](pdf/ICAISC_2023___Zakopane___Poster.pdf),
while the paper can be found [here](pdf/ICAISC_2023___Zakopane.pdf) and under the link [pages.mini.pw.edu.pl](https://pages.mini.pw.edu.pl/~mandziukj/PRACE/ICAISC2023.pdf).
